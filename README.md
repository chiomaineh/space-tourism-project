## My process

- Started by setting up the project with **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS**.
- Implemented routing for different sections (Home, Destination, Crew, Technology) using **React Router**.
- Broke down the Figma design into reusable components.
- Focused on **mobile-first design**, then adjusted layouts with Tailwind’s responsive utilities for tablet and desktop.
- Added state management with `useState` to handle tab switching, navigation dots, and dynamic content.
- Carefully applied **conditional rendering** and responsive background images for each screen size.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind Css
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript

### What I learned

- How to manage **responsive layouts** with Tailwind’s breakpoints and utility classes.
- The difference between `leading` and `tracking` in typography and how they affect readability.
- Handling **image variations** (landscape vs portrait) based on screen sizes.
- How to use `NavLink` with React Router for **active states** in navigation.
- A better understanding of React component structure, props, and conditional class names.
- How to work with **Figma-to-code translation**, balancing design accuracy with clean implementation.
